        <p>Gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part 
            of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked 
            some of the first cultural exchanges between China and the West. This practice has been 
            termed "panda diplomacy".</p>

        <p>Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born, usually 
            only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker 
            cub will die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two 
            cubs since she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.</p>
